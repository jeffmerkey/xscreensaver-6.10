So this works ok:

swayidle -w \
  timeout 60 "xscreensaver-wayland.sh --verbose --start" \
  resume     "xscreensaver-wayland.sh --verbose --stop"

No variant of this works at all, because swaylock doesn't have a "transparent" mode so you can't see the savers:

swayidle -w \
  timeout 60 "xscreensaver-wayland.sh --verbose --start" \
  resume     "xscreensaver-wayland.sh --verbose --stop" \
  timeout 90 'swaylock -f'

"xscreensaver-command --cycle" and whatnot do not work because "xscreensaver" is the one that creates the window for ClientMessages to be delivered to; window's not there. That could be worked around, though.
